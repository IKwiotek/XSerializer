        <description>Encryption
        XSerializer's XML and JSON serializers support the concept of field-level encryption. Properties that are decorated with an [Encrypt] attribute have their values encrypted/decrypted automatically. The actual mechanism to encrypt these fields is exposed through the IEncryptionMechanism interface - users of the encrypt feature are expected to implement this interface in their project.
        
        XML
        XSerializer's XML serialization handles properties and types that the System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer does not handle, such as interfaces and dictionaries. It is meant to be a drop-in replacement for the BCL XmlSerializer - it uses the same attributes: [XmlElement], [XmlAttribute], etc.
        
        JSON
        JSON serialization in XSerializer has better performance than JSON.NET (Newtonsoft). It also has better support for deserialization into a variable or field of type dynamic.</description>
